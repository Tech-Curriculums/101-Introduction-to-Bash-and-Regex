## Creating the script

A step by step description of creating the script is below:

### Wget

`wget` can get the blueprint -- or source code -- of any website. This blueprint will 99% of the time contain all the information presented in the website.


use 

`wget https://www.google.com/` to get the source of google's search engine


to save the output a particular filename (example, `some_site.html` use :

`wget -O "some_site.html" https://www.google.com/`

and your output will be saved into `some_site.html` in the directory you were in when you typed `wget`.
